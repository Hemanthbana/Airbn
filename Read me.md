Hi..

<b><i>Airbnb</i></b>


The purpose of this project is to clone the Airbnb, Inc. website

<b>Project Overview:</b>
                Airbnb, Inc. is an American company that operates an online marketplace for 
lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. Based in San Francisco, California, 
the platform is accessible via website and mobile app. Airbnb does not own any of the listed properties; 
instead, it profits by receiving commission from each booking. The company was founded in 2008 by Brian 
Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk, and Joe Gebbia. Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name, 
AirBedandBreakfast.com.

I've cloned the website details as follows:
<ul>
<li>Signup/login/logout page</li>
<li>Listing page</li>
<li>Host page</li>
<li>Resorts/hotels page</li>
<li>Reservation page</li>
</ul>

Packages used :

<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>ExpressJS</li>
<li>ReactJs</li>
<li>NodeJs</li>
</ul>

Do start this repo. Thank you
